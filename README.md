#### **Project Overview**

**GitQuizGame** is a simple web-based quiz that helps you learn Git commands. You answer questions about Git, get hints, and see if your answers are correct. This project was made as a practice exercise while learning Git, and it might also help others who want to improve their Git skills.

#### **How It Works**

1. **Question Display:**
   - Shows questions about Git commands.
   - You can see one question at a time.

2. **Answering Questions:**
   - You enter your answer and hit "Submit."
   - If the answer is correct, you move to the next question.

3. **Hints and Help:**
   - **Hint:** Shows the correct command for a few seconds.
   - **Help:** Provides an explanation of the current question.

4. **Navigation:**

#### **Flaws of the Project**

- **Limited Explanation:** You won’t get a full explanation about the command; it only shows a brief hint or help.
- **No Code Storage:** There’s no way to store or track your answers or progress beyond the current session.
- **Page Refresh Issue:** When the page is refreshed, the quiz starts from the first question, so you lose your progress.
